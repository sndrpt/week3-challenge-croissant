    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
      shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape,
      the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance,
      and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche
      dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries
      and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
      century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with
      a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
